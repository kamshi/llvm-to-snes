# LLVM IR to the SNES plataform

> This project aims to transform LLVM IR into WLA DX (ASM 65c816), assemble the output and generate a SNES ROM. Please read the links below to further information on SNES and LLVM plataforms.

# How to test it
Install it locally:
  - `cd </path/to/llvm-to-snes/>`
  - `mkdir build-snes && cd build-snes`
  - `cmake -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=X86 .. --build .. -DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=SNES`
  - `make install` _// it might take a while_

Run: _// please read observations below_
  - `clang your_filename.c -S -emit-llvm -o your_filename.ll`
  - `<path/to/llvm-to-snes>/build-snes/bin/llc -march=snes <your_filename>.(ll|bc)`

###### Obs.1
You may test it with any language that compiles to llvm, or you might write it yourself by hand, as long as the file has LLVM extensions `.ll` or `.bc`.

###### Obs.2
SNES (65c816) has a 16-bit architecture and this project up-to-date does not support 32 or 64 bit. A good example for a file test would be:

```C
// sum_file.c
short sum(short a, short b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

###### Obs.3
You may find C files for testing under [./test/Examples/SNES](./test/Examples/SNES)`.

###### Obs.4
The files for this project can be found inside the folder [./lib/Target/SNES/](./lib/Target/SNES/). We have forked the whole LLVM because we have plans of using Docker containers in the future for such tasks.

# How to help
We still have a lot of tasks before creating a first version of this project. All skill levels are welcome to accomplish tasks such as:
  - Testing and [reporting issues](https://github.com/luizperes/llvm-to-snes/issues)
  - Creating test files
  - Working on project documentation
  - Creating libraries for LLVM frontend languages (such as C and Rust)
  - Developing the backend (Check [./lib/Target/SNES/TODO.md](./lib/Target/SNES/TODO.md))
  - Many others
